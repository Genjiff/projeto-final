The inopportune driver notifications is a real problem that may cause distractions and interruptions in traffic and
hence accidents. People usually take 27\% more time to finish a task when they are interrupted and tend to commit the
double amount of mistakes. One of the ways by which drivers are interrupted it's with notifications on mobile devices,
that may reach extremely high amounts in a normal day. Despite that, notifications are valued by users and they are
part of the common use of smartphones. Therefore, how to lessen the interruptive potential of notifications without
eliminating them completely?

To mitigate this problem, the present work propose the development of a context-aware notification system with opportune
and inopportune moments identification for drivers notification. The proposed system use only smartphone sensors (gyroscope
and GPS) to achive this objective.
